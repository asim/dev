# Micro Dev

This is a repository for development and experimentation

## Overview

Ideas are tested and tried in micro/dev before we start to think about incorporating them elsewhere. 
While we could use micro/internal, it means we're adding things with the assumption they will continue 
to exist rather than `write to throwaway`. Experimentation enables write to throwaway as a free flowing 
concept and something we practice. There should be no guarantee that experiments graduate to be official.

## Getting Started
